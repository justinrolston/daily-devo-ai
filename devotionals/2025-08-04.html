<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>What does this text teach us? In Jeremiah 33:2-3, we encounter one of Scripture’s most remarkable invitations. The LORD—who made the earth, formed it, and established it—invites His people to call upon Him with a promise that He will answer and reveal “great and hidden things” they have not known.</p>

<p>Notice how God introduces Himself: as Creator and Sustainer of all things. This isn’t merely background information; it’s the foundation for why we can trust His invitation. The same divine power that spoke the universe into existence and maintains it moment by moment is available to us through prayer. When we call upon the LORD, we’re not approaching a distant deity who might or might not hear us—we’re coming to the sovereign Creator who delights to reveal Himself to His people.</p>

<p>The context makes this promise even more stunning. Jeremiah was imprisoned, Jerusalem was under siege, and God’s people faced imminent judgment for their rebellion. Yet in this darkest hour, God extends an invitation to intimate communion. He promises not just to answer, but to reveal “great and hidden things”—divine truths and purposes that human wisdom cannot discover.</p>

<p>This reveals something profound about God’s character: He is not only sovereign but relational. He doesn’t merely tolerate our prayers; He actively invites them. The God who needs nothing desires fellowship with us. He has secrets He wants to share, wisdom He longs to impart, and purposes He wishes to reveal to those who call upon Him.</p>

<p>For believers today, this passage transforms how we approach prayer. We’re not twisting God’s arm or trying to change His mind. We’re accepting His gracious invitation to participate in His unfolding purposes. When we pray, we align ourselves with the One who “formed the earth to establish it,” trusting that His plans are good and His timing perfect.</p>

<p>The promise isn’t that God will satisfy our curiosity or grant our every wish. Rather, He will reveal what we need to know for faithful living and fruitful service. Sometimes these “hidden things” are insights into His Word, understanding of His providence, or clarity about His will. Other times, they’re simply the deep assurance of His love and presence in our circumstances.</p>

<h2 id="confessional-tie-in">Confessional Tie-in</h2>

<p><em>“Prayer is an offering up of our desires unto God, for things agreeable to his will, in the name of Christ, with confession of our sins, and thankful acknowledgment of his mercies.”</em>
— Westminster Shorter Catechism, Q&amp;A 98</p>

<h2 id="prayer-prompt">Prayer Prompt</h2>

<p>Heavenly Father, You who made and sustain all things, thank You for Your incredible invitation to call upon You. Help me to approach You with confidence, knowing You delight to answer and reveal Your truth. Grant me wisdom to seek first Your kingdom and to trust Your perfect timing in all things.</p>

<h2 id="go-deeper">Go Deeper</h2>

<p>This week, approach prayer not as a duty but as God’s gracious invitation. Ask Him to reveal “hidden things” about His character, His Word, or His purposes for your life. Consider keeping a prayer journal to record how God answers and what He reveals over time.</p>
