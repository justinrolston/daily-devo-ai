<p><strong>Scripture:</strong>
<em>“I hasten and do not delay to keep your commandments.”</em>
— Psalm 119:60</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>

<p>What does this text teach us? The psalmist reveals something remarkable about the believer’s relationship with God’s commands. This isn’t grudging compliance or delayed obedience—it’s eager haste. The Hebrew word for “hasten” suggests urgency and swift action, while “do not delay” emphasizes the absence of procrastination. Together, they paint a picture of someone who cannot wait to align their life with God’s Word.</p>

<p>This verse sits within the longest chapter of the Bible, where the psalmist celebrates God’s law from every conceivable angle. But notice what’s driving this urgency—it’s not fear of punishment or hope of earning favor. The psalmist has already experienced God’s steadfast love and found His commandments to be “sweeter than honey” (v. 103). When we truly understand that God’s commands flow from His perfect love and wisdom, our response changes from reluctant duty to eager delight.</p>

<p>The psalmist’s haste reflects a transformed heart. Before salvation, we naturally resist God’s ways, finding them burdensome or restrictive. But when the Holy Spirit regenerates our hearts, He creates new desires within us. We begin to see God’s commandments not as barriers to freedom, but as pathways to flourishing. Like a child eager to please a beloved parent, we find ourselves wanting to obey quickly and completely.</p>

<p>This eager obedience stands in stark contrast to our natural tendency to delay and rationalize. How often do we sense God’s clear direction—to forgive someone who hurt us, to be generous with our resources, to speak truth in love—yet we hesitate? We delay, making excuses or waiting for more convenient timing. The psalmist models a different way: immediate, joyful compliance with God’s revealed will.</p>

<p>Yet this haste isn’t reckless or thoughtless. It flows from deep meditation on God’s Word and intimate knowledge of His character. The psalmist has learned that God’s ways are always best, always trustworthy, always leading to life. When we know God this way, obedience becomes not just duty but delight, not just obligation but opportunity to align ourselves with perfect wisdom and love.</p>

<p><strong>Confessional Tie-in:</strong>
<em>“The whole counsel of God, concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man’s salvation, faith, and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture.”</em>
— Westminster Confession of Faith 1.6</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Prompt:</strong>
Lord, create in me a heart that delights in Your commands and hastens to obey them. Forgive my tendency to delay and rationalize when Your Word calls for immediate response. Help me see Your commandments as expressions of Your perfect love.</p>

<p><strong>Go Deeper:</strong>
Consider one area where you’ve been delaying obedience to God’s clear commands. What would eager, immediate compliance look like today? Spend time this week meditating on the goodness and wisdom behind God’s instructions, asking Him to transform your heart’s response to His Word.</p>
