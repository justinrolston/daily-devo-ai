                <p><strong>&lt;h2&gt;The Question That Changes Everything&lt;/h2&gt;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Scripture:</strong>
<em>“He said to them, ‘But who do you say that I am?’ Simon Peter replied, ‘You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.’”</em>
— Matthew 16:15-16</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>

<p>What does this text teach us? Jesus poses the most important question anyone will ever face: “Who do you say that I am?” Notice the personal nature of His inquiry. He had just asked what others were saying about Him, but now He presses closer to the heart. This isn’t a question about popular opinion or theological speculation—it’s a demand for personal confession.</p>

<p>Peter’s response reveals divine truth: Jesus is both the promised Messiah (“the Christ”) and deity incarnate (“the Son of the living God”). This confession encompasses Jesus’ full identity—truly human as the anointed King from David’s line, and truly divine as God’s eternal Son. Peter didn’t arrive at this truth through human wisdom; Jesus later explains that the Father revealed it to him (verse 17).</p>

<p>This passage confronts us with the same urgent question Jesus posed to His disciples. In our culture of religious pluralism, many are content to view Jesus as merely a good teacher, moral example, or inspiring figure. But Jesus doesn’t allow such comfortable distance. He demands we grapple with His true identity and respond personally.</p>

<p>The beauty of Peter’s confession is that it acknowledges both our desperate need and God’s perfect provision. As “the Christ,” Jesus fulfills every Old Testament promise of salvation. As “the Son of the living God,” He possesses the divine power to accomplish what no human could—our complete redemption from sin and death.</p>

<p>Yet we must remember that Peter spoke these words before fully understanding their implications. Soon he would deny Jesus three times, demonstrating that even true faith battles against our remaining sin. Our confession of Christ as Lord is not a one-time declaration but a daily surrender, repeatedly choosing to trust in His identity and work rather than our own righteousness.</p>

<p>This question echoes through eternity because our answer determines everything. To confess Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, is to acknowledge Him as our only hope for forgiveness, righteousness, and eternal life. It’s to bow before His authority and rest in His finished work.</p>

<p><strong>Confessional Tie-in:</strong>
<em>“Christ, being the eternal Son of God, became man, and so was, and continues to be, God and man in two distinct natures, and one person, forever.”</em>
— Westminster Confession of Faith 8.2</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Prompt:</strong>
Lord Jesus, I confess with Peter that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. Thank You that this truth wasn’t discovered by human wisdom but revealed by Your Father’s grace. Help me live today in light of who You truly are—my Savior, Lord, and King.</p>

<p><strong>Go Deeper:</strong>
Consider how your daily decisions reflect your answer to Jesus’ question. Are there areas where you’re living as though Jesus were merely a good teacher rather than the sovereign Son of God? Take time to meditate on both aspects of His identity—His humanity that enables Him to sympathize with your weaknesses, and His divinity that gives Him power to save completely.</p>
