                <h1>The Heart of the Kingdom</h1>

<h2>Scripture:</h2>
<p><em>"...but Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.'"</em><br />
— Matthew 19:14</p>

<h2>Reflection:</h2>

<p>What does this text teach us about the nature of God's kingdom? When the disciples tried to shield Jesus from the interruption of children, they revealed their misunderstanding of both their Master's heart and His kingdom's character. But Jesus' response cuts through our adult assumptions about importance and access to divine grace.</p>

<p>Notice that Jesus doesn't merely tolerate children—He actively welcomes them and declares that the kingdom of heaven belongs "to such as these." This isn't sentimentality about childhood innocence, for Scripture is clear that we are all born in sin. Rather, Jesus points to essential qualities that children naturally display: dependence, trust, and humble receptivity.</p>

<p>Children come to Jesus without pretense. They don't calculate their worthiness or rehearse their credentials. They simply receive what is offered with open hands and believing hearts. This is precisely how we must approach God—not through our achievements or spiritual maturity, but through childlike faith that rests entirely on His grace.</p>

<p>The Greek word for "hinder" here means to cut off or prevent access. How often do we, like the disciples, create barriers between people and Jesus? Sometimes we hinder others through harsh judgment or spiritual elitism. Other times we hinder ourselves, believing we must somehow become more acceptable before approaching our Savior.</p>

<p>But Jesus' invitation remains unchanged: "Come to me." Not when you're older, wiser, or more put-together. Not after you've proven your commitment or cleaned up your life. Come now, with the simple trust of a child who knows their Father loves them.</p>

<p>This passage also reveals God's sovereign grace in choosing the humble and dependent. The kingdom belongs to those who, like children, have nothing to offer but empty hands and trusting hearts. In God's economy, weakness becomes the doorway to His strength, and dependence becomes the pathway to His provision.</p>

<h2>Confessional Tie-in:</h2>
<p><em>"Faith is not only a knowledge and conviction that everything God reveals in his word is true; it is also a deep-rooted assurance, created in me by the Holy Spirit through the gospel, that, out of sheer grace earned for us by Christ, not only others, but I too, have had my sins forgiven, have been made right with God, and have been granted salvation."</em><br />
— Heidelberg Catechism, Question 21</p>

<h2>Prayer Prompt:</h2>
<p>Heavenly Father, grant me a childlike heart that approaches You with simple trust and open hands. Help me remove any barriers that keep others from coming to Jesus, and remind me daily that Your kingdom belongs to those who depend entirely on Your grace.</p>

<h2>Go Deeper:</h2>
<p>Today, examine your own heart: Are you approaching God with childlike dependence, or are you still trying to earn His favor? Consider how you might be hindering others from experiencing Jesus' welcome, and ask God to show you opportunities to extend His invitation with the same warmth Christ shows to you.</p>
