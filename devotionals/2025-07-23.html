<p><strong>Scripture:</strong>
<em>“…but Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.’”</em>
— Matthew 19:14</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>

<p>What does this text teach us? When the disciples tried to turn away children from Jesus, they revealed a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of God’s kingdom. They saw children as interruptions to important ministry, but Jesus saw them as illustrations of kingdom citizenship itself.</p>

<p>Jesus wasn’t simply being kind to children—though His tenderness here is beautiful. He was making a profound theological statement: “to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.” The Greek word for “belongs” indicates ownership, inheritance, and rightful possession. Children don’t merely receive the kingdom; it belongs to them by its very nature.</p>

<p>But why children? What do they possess that kingdom citizens must have? Children approach life with complete dependence, trusting vulnerability, and unpretentious humility. They don’t negotiate their way into their parents’ love or earn their place at the family table. They simply receive what is freely given.</p>

<p>This strikes at the heart of our fallen nature. We instinctively want to contribute to our salvation, to bring something worthy to God. We’re uncomfortable with the idea that we must come empty-handed, like children who have nothing to offer but need. Yet this is precisely what the gospel demands—and graciously provides.</p>

<p>The kingdom belongs to those who recognize their spiritual poverty and cast themselves entirely upon God’s mercy. It belongs to those who trust not in their own righteousness, but in Christ’s perfect righteousness credited to their account. It belongs to those who approach the throne of grace not as self-made adults, but as dependent children of their heavenly Father.</p>

<p>Notice that Jesus doesn’t tell the children to become like adults; rather, throughout His ministry, He consistently calls adults to become like children. Spiritual maturity, paradoxically, includes growing in our understanding of how desperately we need our Savior.</p>

<p>This passage also challenges us to examine what we might be hindering in God’s kingdom work. Are we creating barriers that Jesus would remove? Are we complicating what He has made simple? The same heart that welcomes children also welcomes the broken, the outcast, and the unlikely.</p>

<p><strong>Confessional Tie-in:</strong>
<em>“We believe that our salvation consists in the remission of our sins for Jesus Christ’s sake, and that therein our righteousness before God is implied: as David and Paul teach us, declaring this to be the happiness of man, that God imputes righteousness to him without works.”</em>
— Belgic Confession, Article 23</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Prompt:</strong>
Heavenly Father, thank You that Your kingdom belongs to those who come as children—empty-handed but trusting in Your goodness. Help me to approach You today not with pride in my accomplishments, but with humble dependence on Your grace alone.</p>

<p><strong>Go Deeper:</strong>
Today, practice childlike dependence by bringing one worry or burden directly to God without first trying to solve it yourself. Consider also: What barriers might you be creating that prevent others from easily approaching Christ?</p>
