<p><strong>Scripture:</strong>
<em>“…but Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.’”</em>
— Matthew 19:14</p>

<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>

<p>What does this tender scene teach us about the nature of God’s kingdom and our place within it? The disciples, perhaps thinking they were protecting Jesus from distraction, sought to turn away parents bringing their children to Him. But Christ’s response reveals something profound about both His heart and His kingdom.</p>

<p>When Jesus declares that “to such belongs the kingdom of heaven,” He isn’t merely being kind to children. He’s revealing the essential character required for kingdom citizenship. Children possess qualities that we, in our adult sophistication, often lose: complete dependence, unquestioning trust, and humble receptivity. They don’t approach with credentials or achievements—they simply come.</p>

<p>This passage strikes at the heart of our natural pride. We’re inclined to think we must bring something impressive to God—our good works, our spiritual maturity, our theological knowledge. Yet Jesus teaches that the kingdom belongs to those who come with empty hands and dependent hearts, just as children naturally do.</p>

<p>The phrase “do not hinder them” carries a sobering warning. How often do we create barriers that keep people from Christ? Sometimes through religious complexity, sometimes through cultural expectations, sometimes through our own prideful attitudes. We can become like the disciples, well-meaning but misguided gatekeepers.</p>

<p>Notice too the active invitation: “Let the little children come to me.” Jesus doesn’t merely tolerate children; He welcomes them. This same welcoming heart extends to all who approach Him with childlike faith. Regardless of your background, your past failures, or your current struggles, Christ’s invitation remains: “Come to me.”</p>

<p>The kingdom of heaven operates on radically different principles than earthly kingdoms. Here, the greatest are servants, the first are last, and entrance requires not achievement but faith—the kind of simple, dependent faith that children naturally possess.</p>

<p>For believers, this passage both comforts and challenges. It comforts us that our standing before God doesn’t depend on our spiritual sophistication but on Christ’s finished work received by faith. It challenges us to examine whether we’ve erected barriers that hinder others from coming to Jesus, and whether we’ve lost the simple, dependent faith that first brought us to Him.</p>

<p><strong>Confessional Tie-in:</strong>
<em>“Faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I hold for truth all that God has revealed to us in his word, but also an assured confidence, which the Holy Ghost works by the gospel in my heart; that not only to others, but to me also, remission of sin, everlasting righteousness and salvation, are freely given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ’s merits.”</em>
— Heidelberg Catechism, Q&amp;A 21</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Prompt:</strong>
Heavenly Father, grant me the simple, dependent faith of a child. Help me approach You not with pride in my achievements, but with humble trust in Christ alone. Show me any ways I might be hindering others from coming to Jesus, and give me His welcoming heart.</p>

<p><strong>Go Deeper:</strong>
Consider how you approach God in prayer and worship—do you come with childlike dependence or adult self-sufficiency? Reflect on Jesus’ other teachings about children and humility (Matthew 18:3-4, Mark 10:15) to deepen your understanding of kingdom citizenship.</p>
