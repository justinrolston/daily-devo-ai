<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>What does this text teach us? In 1 Samuel 16:7, we witness a profound moment where God corrects the prophet Samuel’s perspective. As Samuel considers Jesse’s sons for anointing as Israel’s next king, he naturally gravitates toward Eliab, likely impressed by his physical presence and stature. Yet God immediately redirects Samuel’s attention from the external to the internal: “The LORD looks on the heart.”</p>

<p>This divine correction reveals a fundamental truth about how God sees and evaluates people. While humans instinctively assess others based on outward appearance, social status, or impressive credentials, God’s vision penetrates far deeper. He sees our true character, our hidden motives, our secret thoughts, and the genuine condition of our souls. This isn’t merely about God having better insight—it reflects His perfect justice and wisdom in judgment.</p>

<p>The broader biblical narrative confirms this pattern. God chose Abraham from a pagan family, selected Moses despite his speech impediment, and elevated David from shepherding sheep to shepherding Israel. Throughout Scripture, we see the Lord repeatedly choosing the unlikely, the overlooked, and the ordinary to accomplish His extraordinary purposes. This reminds us that God’s ways are not our ways, and His thoughts are higher than our thoughts.</p>

<p>For believers today, this truth should profoundly shape how we view ourselves and others. When we feel inadequate because we lack certain external qualifications or when we’re tempted to judge others by superficial standards, we must remember that God’s evaluation system operates on entirely different principles. He values a humble heart over an impressive resume, genuine faith over polished performance, and authentic love over external religiosity.</p>

<p>This passage also confronts our tendency toward people-pleasing and image management. Since God sees our hearts completely, our energy is better invested in cultivating inner godliness rather than crafting perfect external appearances. The question becomes not “How do I look to others?” but “What does God see when He examines my heart?” This shift in perspective can free us from the exhausting pursuit of human approval and redirect us toward the joy of divine acceptance through Christ.</p>

<p><em>“Man by his fall having made himself incapable of life by that covenant, the Lord was pleased to make a second, commonly called the covenant of grace; wherein He freely offers unto sinners life and salvation by Jesus Christ, requiring of them faith in Him, that they may be saved.”</em>
— Westminster Confession of Faith 7.3</p>

<h2 id="prayer-prompt">Prayer Prompt</h2>

<p>Heavenly Father, thank You that You see past my external failures and shortcomings straight to my heart. Help me to value what You value and to see others as You see them—not by worldly standards but through eyes of grace and truth.</p>

<h2 id="go-deeper">Go Deeper</h2>

<p>Examine your own tendencies to judge by appearances this week. When meeting new people or evaluating situations, pause to ask what God might see that you’re missing. Consider journaling about areas where you seek human approval rather than focusing on heart-level faithfulness to Christ.</p>
