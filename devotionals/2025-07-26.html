<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p>What does this text teach us about the nature of faith? The author of Hebrews provides us with one of Scripture’s most profound definitions: faith is both “assurance of things hoped for” and “conviction of things not seen.” This isn’t merely intellectual agreement or wishful thinking—it’s a God-given certainty about spiritual realities that transcend our physical senses.</p>

<p>The Greek word for “assurance” (<em>hypostasis</em>) carries the meaning of substance or foundation. Faith isn’t built on shifting emotions or circumstances, but on the solid foundation of God’s promises. It’s the confident expectation that what God has declared will surely come to pass. When we hope for Christ’s return, for resurrection, for glory—faith makes these future realities as certain as if they were already accomplished.</p>

<p>Similarly, “conviction” (<em>elegchos</em>) refers to proof or evidence. Faith serves as our evidence for unseen spiritual truths. We cannot see God’s throne, Christ’s intercession, or the Holy Spirit’s work within us, yet faith provides unshakeable conviction of these realities. This is why believers can live with such confidence despite the world’s skepticism.</p>

<p>This definition comes at the beginning of Hebrews 11, often called the “Hall of Faith,” where we see ordinary people accomplishing extraordinary things through faith. Noah built an ark before rain fell. Abraham left his homeland for an unknown destination. Moses chose suffering over earthly pleasure. What enabled such radical obedience? Faith that made unseen realities more real than visible circumstances.</p>

<p>For us today, this means our Christian life isn’t based on what we can measure or control. We serve a God we cannot see, pray to a Savior who ascended to heaven, and depend on a Spirit whose work is often imperceptible. Yet faith makes these spiritual realities the most certain aspects of our existence.</p>

<p>This challenges our natural tendency to trust only what we can verify through our senses. Faith calls us to live according to God’s truth rather than worldly wisdom, to find our security in His promises rather than material possessions, and to invest in eternal treasures rather than temporary pleasures.</p>

<p>When trials come and God seems distant, faith anchors us to His unchanging character. When the world mocks our beliefs, faith provides unwavering conviction. This is how we “walk by faith, not by sight”—trusting completely in our faithful God.</p>

<h2 id="confessional-tie-in">Confessional Tie-in</h2>

<p><em>“By this faith, a Christian believes to be true whatsoever is revealed in the Word, for the authority of God Himself speaking therein; and acts differently upon that which each particular passage thereof contains; yielding obedience to the commands, trembling at the threatenings, and embracing the promises of God for this life, and that which is to come.”</em>
— Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 14.2</p>

<h2 id="prayer-prompt">Prayer Prompt</h2>

<p>Heavenly Father, strengthen my faith to see beyond the temporary and visible to the eternal and unseen. Help me live with the confident assurance that Your promises are more certain than anything my eyes can see, trusting fully in Your faithful character.</p>

<h2 id="go-deeper">Go Deeper</h2>

<p>Consider one area where you’re tempted to trust visible circumstances over God’s promises. How might growing faith change your perspective and actions? Spend time meditating on God’s faithfulness throughout Scripture, allowing these truths to build your conviction in unseen spiritual realities.</p>
