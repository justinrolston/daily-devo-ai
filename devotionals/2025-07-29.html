<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

<p><strong>“I will never forget your precepts, for by them you have given me life.”</strong> What does this remarkable statement from the psalmist teach us about God’s Word and its power in our lives?</p>

<p>The psalmist declares an unshakeable commitment: he will never forget God’s precepts. These aren’t merely suggestions or helpful guidelines—they are divine instructions that carry the very life of God. The Hebrew word for “precepts” speaks of detailed commands that govern every aspect of life. Yet notice the psalmist’s motivation: it’s not duty alone, but gratitude for the life these words have brought him.</p>

<p>When the psalmist says God’s precepts have “given me life,” he’s pointing to something profound. This isn’t merely biological existence, but true spiritual vitality—the kind of abundant life that comes only from God. In a world filled with empty philosophies and fleeting pleasures, God’s Word alone provides the sustenance our souls desperately need.</p>

<p>This echoes throughout Scripture. Jesus himself declared, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God” (Matthew 4:4). The apostle Peter, when asked if he would abandon Jesus, responded, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life” (John 6:68). God’s Word doesn’t merely inform us—it transforms us, regenerates us, and sustains us.</p>

<p>But here’s the beautiful paradox: the very ability to treasure God’s Word comes from God himself. Our natural hearts are prone to forget, to drift, to find God’s commands burdensome. When we find ourselves loving Scripture, delighting in prayer, and longing for spiritual growth, we’re witnessing God’s grace at work. He gives us new hearts that can receive his life-giving truth.</p>

<p>This should humble us and encourage us simultaneously. Are there seasons when God’s Word feels dry or burdensome? This is normal in our Christian journey. But we can pray for renewed hearts, asking God to awaken fresh love for his truth. His precepts remain life-giving even when our feelings fluctuate.</p>

<p>The psalmist’s “never forget” isn’t mere mental retention—it’s active remembrance that shapes how we live, love, and respond to life’s challenges.</p>

<p><em>“The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for His own glory, man’s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture: unto which nothing at any time is to be added, whether by new revelations of the Spirit, or traditions of men.”</em>
— Westminster Confession of Faith 1.6</p>

<h2 id="prayer-prompt">Prayer Prompt</h2>

<p>Father, thank you that your Word brings life to my weary soul. When I’m tempted to look elsewhere for meaning and satisfaction, remind me that your precepts are my true source of spiritual vitality. Help me never to forget your life-giving truth.</p>

<h2 id="go-deeper">Go Deeper</h2>

<p>Identify one specific area where you need God’s Word to bring fresh life today—perhaps a relationship, decision, or struggle. Meditate on how Scripture speaks to that situation. Consider memorizing this verse as a reminder that God’s precepts are not burdens, but gifts of life.</p>
