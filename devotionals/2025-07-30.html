<p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>

<p>What does this text teach us? Jesus makes a startling declaration about His followers: “You are the light of the world.” Not “you will be” or “you should try to be,” but “you are.” This isn’t wishful thinking or motivational speaking—it’s a statement of spiritual reality for every believer.</p>

<p>Light, by its very nature, reveals and illuminates. In a world darkened by sin, Christians possess something the world desperately needs: the light of Christ dwelling within them. Jesus uses the image of a city on a hill to emphasize that this light is meant to be visible. A city perched on elevated ground cannot hide its presence, especially at night when its lights pierce the darkness. Similarly, the transformed life of a believer naturally stands out in contrast to the surrounding spiritual darkness.</p>

<p>But notice the purpose of this visibility. Our light doesn’t shine to draw attention to ourselves or to showcase our own goodness. Verse 16 makes clear that our good works should point others to “give glory to your Father who is in heaven.” This is the heart of Christian living—we reflect God’s character through our actions so that others might see His glory and be drawn to Him.</p>

<p>This calling can feel overwhelming. How can we, aware of our own struggles and failures, be light in such a dark world? The answer lies in understanding that this light isn’t our own—it’s Christ’s light shining through us. We don’t generate this light through moral effort; rather, we reflect the light of Jesus who called Himself “the light of the world” (John 8:12).</p>

<p>The good works Jesus mentions aren’t done to earn salvation but flow naturally from hearts transformed by grace. When we love sacrificially, speak truthfully, forgive generously, and serve humbly, we display the character of our heavenly Father. These actions create curiosity in others about the source of such counter-cultural living.</p>

<p>This passage challenges both our isolation and our inconsistency. We cannot hide our faith in private spirituality, nor can we shine Christ’s light while living in patterns of sin. Instead, we’re called to intentional, visible faithfulness that points beyond ourselves to the God who has made us His children.</p>

<p><strong>Confessional Tie-in:</strong>
<em>“God is glorified in us, when we are satisfied in him.”</em>
— Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 16, Article 2 (on good works)</p>

<p><strong>Prayer Prompt:</strong>
Father, thank You for making me a light in this dark world through Christ. Help me to shine Your light consistently today through words and actions that reflect Your character, not for my own glory but so others might see You and give You praise.</p>

<p><strong>Go Deeper:</strong>
Consider one specific area of your life where you might be hiding your light under a bushel. Ask yourself: “How can my words, actions, or attitudes today point someone toward God’s glory?” Spend time meditating on how Christ’s light first penetrated your own darkness, fueling gratitude that naturally overflows in good works.</p>
