# Daily Devotional Creation Prompt

**{{VERSE_REFERENCE}}** (ESV)
"{{VERSE_TEXT}}"

## Devotional Generation Instructions

Generate a 3-5 minute devotional (approximately 400-500 words) based on the Scripture passage provided.

## Target Audience
Believers in Christ seeking daily spiritual formation grounded in biblical truth. While the theological perspective is Reformed, avoid insider language or explicitly denominational terms. Focus on clear biblical exposition that naturally reflects Reformed understanding.

## Required Format

**Title:** [Compelling, descriptive title that captures the main theme - plain text only, no HTML tags]

**Reflection:** [300-350 words]
- Begin with the text itself - what does it say and mean?
- Connect to broader biblical themes and theology
- Apply to daily Christian living
- Maintain Reformed theological framework without being overtly denominational
- Write in an accessible, pastoral tone that speaks to both heart and mind
- Address real-life struggles and joys of believers

**Confessional Tie-in:**
*"[Relevant quote from Westminster Confession/Catechisms, Heidelberg Catechism, or Belgic Confession]"*
â€” [Source and question/article number]

**Prayer Prompt:**
[2-3 sentence prayer that may follow ACTS pattern (Adoration, Confession, Thanksgiving, Supplication) or focus on specific needs arising from the passage. Keep it personal and applicable.]

**Go Deeper:**
[2-3 sentences offering both practical application and opportunities for further study/meditation. Suggest specific ways to live out the truth or questions for deeper reflection.]

## Theological Guidelines
- **Scripture's Authority & Inerrancy**: Bible as God's perfect, authoritative Word for all faith and practice
- **Expository Foundation**: Begin with careful attention to what the text actually says in context
- **Total Depravity**: Honest acknowledgment of sin's pervasive effects and our complete dependence on grace
- **Justification by Faith Alone**: Imputed righteousness through Christ alone, not human works
- **God's Sovereignty**: His absolute rule over salvation, providence, and all creation
- **Progressive Sanctification**: Spirit-empowered growth in holiness as God's ongoing work
- **Christ's Centrality**: Jesus as Prophet, Priest, and King throughout all Scripture
- **Church's Role**: Means of grace through Word, sacraments, and fellowship
- **Glory of God**: Ultimate purpose of salvation and Christian living

## Style Guidelines
- Warm, pastoral tone that is both theological and accessible
- Avoid Reformed jargon; use clear, biblical language
- Balance doctrinal depth with practical application
- Write for someone who has 3-5 minutes for meaningful reflection
- Include questions or prompts that encourage personal application
- Connect ancient biblical truth to modern Christian living
- Begin reflection with "What does this text teach us?" before moving to application
- Include brief attention to historical/cultural context when relevant
- Address both believer's position in Christ AND their ongoing growth
- Balance comfort for the afflicted with affliction for the comfortable

## What to Avoid
- Overly academic or technical language
- Denominational terminology that excludes other believers
- Shallow moralism or "life tips" without theological foundation
- Legalistic applications that burden rather than encourage
- Cultural or political commentary unless directly relevant to the text

Generate a devotional that will anchor a believer's heart in biblical truth while providing practical guidance for faithful Christian living.
