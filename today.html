<h2 id="scripture">Scripture:</h2>
<p><em>“I hasten and do not delay to keep your commandments.”</em>
— Psalm 119:60</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection:</h2>

<p>What does this text teach us about the believer’s response to God’s Word? The psalmist declares a remarkable urgency in obedience—not grudging compliance, but eager haste to follow God’s commandments. The Hebrew word translated “hasten” carries the sense of hurrying with purpose, like a runner pressing toward the finish line.</p>

<p>This verse reveals something profound about the transformed heart. When God’s Spirit works within us, obedience becomes not a burden but a delight. The psalmist doesn’t say “I eventually get around to keeping your commandments” or “I reluctantly drag my feet toward obedience.” Instead, he hastens—he moves with holy urgency toward what God requires.</p>

<p>Why such eagerness? Because God’s commandments are not arbitrary restrictions but expressions of His perfect character and pathways to flourishing life. When we truly understand that God’s laws flow from His love and are designed for our good and His glory, delay becomes unthinkable. We begin to see obedience not as limitation but as liberation—freedom to live as we were created to live.</p>

<p>This urgency also reflects our gratitude for salvation. Having been rescued from sin’s dominion and brought into God’s family through Christ’s perfect obedience, how can we respond with anything less than wholehearted devotion? Our Savior hastened to the cross without delay; surely we can hasten to follow His commands without delay.</p>

<p>Yet we must be honest about our struggles. How often do we delay obedience, knowing what God requires but hesitating to act? Perhaps we delay forgiveness when wronged, postpone difficult conversations, or procrastinate in generous giving. The psalmist’s example challenges our spiritual lethargy and calls us to examine what holds us back.</p>

<p>The key lies in remembering that our obedience, empowered by the Holy Spirit, brings joy to our heavenly Father’s heart. When we hasten to keep His commandments, we demonstrate that His Word has truly taken root in our lives, producing the fruit of eager submission and grateful service.</p>

<h2 id="confessional-tie-in">Confessional Tie-in:</h2>
<p><em>“The whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory, man’s salvation, faith and life, is either expressly set down in Scripture, or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture.”</em>
— Westminster Confession of Faith 1.6</p>

<h2 id="prayer-prompt">Prayer Prompt:</h2>
<p>Father, forgive me for the times I have delayed obedience to Your Word. Create in me a heart that hastens to follow Your commandments, not from duty alone but from love and gratitude for Your grace. Help me to see Your commands as expressions of Your perfect love.</p>

<h2 id="go-deeper">Go Deeper:</h2>
<p>Consider one area where you’ve been delaying obedience to God’s clear instruction. What would it look like to “hasten and not delay” in that specific situation today? Reflect on how Christ’s perfect obedience on your behalf motivates your own eager response to God’s Word.</p>
