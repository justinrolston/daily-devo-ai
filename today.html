                <h2>Walking in God's Light</h2>

<p><strong>Scripture:</strong><br />
<em>"But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin."</em><br />
— 1 John 1:7</p>

<h3>Reflection:</h3>

<p>John presents us with a beautiful picture of Christian life: walking in the light as God himself is in the light. This isn't merely about moral behavior or trying harder to be good. The "light" John describes represents truth, holiness, and the very nature of God himself. When we walk in this light, we're living in alignment with who God is and what He has revealed about himself.</p>

<p>Notice that John doesn't say "if we <em>have</em> walked" or "if we <em>will</em> walk," but "if we walk"—present tense, ongoing action. This walking in the light is the continuous posture of a believer's life. It's not perfection, but direction. We stumble, we fall short, yet we keep moving toward the light rather than retreating into darkness.</p>

<p>The fruit of this light-walking is twofold. First, we experience genuine fellowship with one another. True Christian community isn't built on shared interests or personality compatibility, but on our common walk in God's light. When we're honest about our struggles and transparent about God's work in our lives, real fellowship flourishes.</p>

<p>Second, and remarkably, John tells us that as we walk in the light, "the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin." This cleansing isn't earned by our walking—it's the ongoing work of Christ's sacrifice applied to our lives. The light doesn't hide our sin; it exposes it, and in that exposure, Christ's blood covers it completely.</p>

<p>This means we don't have to fear the light. We don't need to hide our failures or pretend we have it all together. The light that reveals our sin is the same light that assures us of Christ's cleansing. What comfort this brings to the believer who feels the weight of their shortcomings! Our security isn't in our perfect walking, but in the perfect blood of Jesus that continually cleanses us.</p>

<p>Today, choose to walk in the light rather than hiding in the shadows of self-deception or isolation. Embrace honest fellowship with other believers, knowing that Christ's blood covers every failure you bring into the light.</p>

<h3>Confessional Tie-in:</h3>

<p><em>"They who are effectually called do in this life partake of justification, adoption, and sanctification, and the several benefits which in this life do either accompany or flow from them."</em><br />
— Westminster Confession of Faith, Chapter 11.1</p>

<h3>Prayer Prompt:</h3>

<p>Father, thank you that your light doesn't condemn but cleanses. Help me walk honestly in your truth today, embracing both the fellowship you provide and the cleansing blood of Jesus that makes such fellowship possible.</p>

<h3>Go Deeper:</h3>

<p>Consider one area where you've been hiding in darkness rather than walking in God's light. How might bringing this into honest fellowship with other believers allow Christ's cleansing to work more fully? Reflect on how the security of Christ's blood frees you to live with greater transparency and authenticity.</p>
